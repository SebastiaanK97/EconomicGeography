# Economic Geography of Technological Change

The Core-Periphery Setting of Technological Change

An explanatory logistic regression model for statistical inference to estimate the effect of interregional linkages on technological diversification in peripheral regions & an exploratory approach to investigate technological diversification from an econonomic evolutionary perspective.

*To what extent does the diversification into new technological fields within regions depend on interregional linkages and vary over the geographical and the functional perspective?*

*What are the similarities and the differences of diversification into new technological\\fields with regards to the geographical and the functional perspective?*
